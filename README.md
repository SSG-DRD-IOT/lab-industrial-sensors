# Sensors and Actuators

## Lab Overview

These labs will guide you through a series of exercises using sensors and actuators using the open source [MRAA](https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) libraries.

## Table of Contents

These examples are written in C++ and can be compiled with the Arduino Create developer environment, Intel System Studio or with GCC. 

Below labs can be done with the UP2 Groove IoT Development Kit Sensors. 

* [Introduction to the MRAA and UPM libraries](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-overview-mraa-and-upm-libraries/)
* [Digital GPIO Example](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-digital-sensors-arduino)
* [PWM Example](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-pwm-sensors-arduino)
* [I<sup>2</sup>C LCD Example](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-lcd-arduino)
* [Get Your IP Address and Display it on the LCD](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-IP-to-LCD-Arduino)
* [Temperature sensors](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-temperature-humidity-arduino)
* [Rotary Angle sensors](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/lab-rotary-angle-sensor-c)

Following lab has been prepared to demonstrate the difference between using C++ compared to UPM/MRAA libaries respectively, which requires you to have HC04-SR Ultrasound sensor.
